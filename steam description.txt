Welcome to Golden Edition: A World War 2 Enhancement Mod, crafted by TK2030 to elevate your Hearts of Iron IV experience to higher levels of realism and challenge. This mod is designed to make single-player gameplay significantly harder and more immersive, transforming your WWII strategy with a host of new features and mechanics. This is my take on Vanilla+.

Enhanced Historical Realism: Experience a more accurate World War II with decisions to partition Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, Switzerland, and the USSR.

Strategic Depth: Invite Japan to attack the USSR if Germany is winning, and watch as the Soviets engage in fierce defensive mechanics for Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Moscow.

Allied Guarantees Mechanic: See dynamic Allied responses to aggression from the Soviets, Germans, and Italians, no more blobbing out of control in 1936.

Dynamic Interventions: German and Soviet interventions are triggered if either nation attacks Poland without the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.

UK Relocation Mechanic: If Britain is defeated, watch as the UK government relocates to Canada, continuing the fight from a new base.

Resistance Mechanics: The Chinese and Soviet resistance events slow down Japanese and German advances respectively, adding strategic complexity.

Elite Divisions & Operations: Command a host of elite units and divisions, including all 38 Waffen SS divisions, the Spanish Blue Division, and iconic units like Grossdeutschland, Panzerlehr, Brandenburgers, Fallschirm Panzer Herman Goring, and Afrika Korps. Experience major operations from both Axis and Allied powers, including Case White, Barbarossa, Operation Torch, Operation Overlord, and many more.

American & British Special Units: Utilize specialized American units such as the Paramarines, Army Rangers, and Marine Raiders, as well as British forces like the SAS, SBS, and Royal Marine Commandos.

Comprehensive Unit Integration: All German Order Police Battalions, Luftwaffe Field Divisions, Kriegsmarine Naval Infantry Divisions, and all 194 Soviet Guard Divisions are included.

For an even richer gameplay experience, consider playing Golden Edition alongside its sister mod, Better Formable Nations and Coring Decisions. This complementary mod enhances formable nations and core decision mechanics, further deepening your strategic options.
