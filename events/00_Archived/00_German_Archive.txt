 EW_Germany_Country.204.d:0 "Mein FÃ¼hrer, recent reports confirm that the Soviet Union has launched an aggressive invasion of Lithuania, seeking to reclaim territories lost to them. This presents us with an unexpected opportunity. By offering Lithuania military assistance, we could turn this situation to our advantage. In exchange for our support, we could demand the return of the Memel territory, which was unjustly taken from us. This move could not only strengthen our strategic position but also create a powerful ally against the Bolsheviks."

They are willing to declare war on the Soviet Union and provide military assistance to Lithuania. However, there is a condition: in exchange for their support, the Germans demand the Memel Territory. This offer presents a unique opportunity to gain critical allies and secure the safety of our nation. We must decide whether to accept this offer or resist the Soviets independently."
