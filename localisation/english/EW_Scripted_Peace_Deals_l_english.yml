 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.1.t:0 "A Proposal for Peace with the West"
 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.1.d:0 "Mein Führer, The time has come to consider a proposition that could alter the course of our struggle. The war in the West has demanded significant resources and countless divisions, tying up troops that could be better deployed elsewhere. As we stand on the brink of a decisive showdown with Bolshevism, peace with the Western Allies would free these forces, allowing us to redirect our full might against the true enemy in the East. However, caution must be exercised. We must carefully weigh our demands and avoid overreach, as an excessive list of conditions will surely result in our offers being dismissed outright. The Western Allies may be weary, but they will not accept terms that appear to be mere capitulation. A reasonable approach could pave the way to securing our rear, while an aggressive stance risks prolonging a war that diverts us from our ultimate goal; the annihilation of Bolshevism. We stand at a crossroads. Shall we explore a path to peace, or do we remain committed to the pursuit of final victory on all fronts? The choice is yours, Mein Führer."

 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.2.t:0 "Our Demands in Western Europe"
 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.2.d:0 "Mein Führer, As we begin drafting our peace proposal to the Western Allies, we must carefully consider the nature of our territorial demands. Each set of demands carries distinct strategic implications, and the harsher our terms, the less likely they are to be accepted. Our first option is the most lenient; Germany would withdraw to the 1939 borders, abandoning all conquests in Western Europe. This choice represents a desperate bid for peace at any price, prioritizing the Eastern Front above all else, but it would be seen as a humiliating retreat and a blow to our prestige. The second option proposes annexing Alsace, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, retaining key ethnically German territories while withdrawing from the rest of the West. This balanced approach aims to secure our historical borders without appearing overly aggressive, offering a reasonable compromise that might appeal to the Allies’ desire for a swift end to the war. Our third option is more ambitious, seeking to annex Alsace, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, and Nord-Pas-de-Calais. This proposal invokes historical claims to the Low Countries and Northern France, based on our ties to the Holy Roman Empire. However, it risks being seen as an overreach, likely only acceptable to the Allies under desperate circumstances. Finally, our most extreme demand would involve the annexation of all Germanic territories, including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Low Countries, alongside Switzerland. This reflects our vision of a Greater Germanic Reich, uniting all Germanic peoples under one banner. Such a demand, however, would be viewed as the most provocative and would almost certainly be rejected unless the Allies were on the brink of collapse. The choice before us is critical; a moderate approach may bring peace swiftly, while more ambitious demands could prolong the conflict, undermining our efforts against Bolshevism in the East."

 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.3.t:0 "Our Colonial Empire"
 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.3.d:0 "Mein Führer, In addition to our demands in Europe, we must decide the fate of Germany’s colonial ambitions. While our primary focus remains the struggle in the East, the question of our overseas territories cannot be ignored. The Western Allies may be more amenable to peace if we forgo our colonial claims entirely, allowing us to concentrate fully on the European theater. This first option would signal a significant concession, dropping any colonial demands in exchange for the potential of a swift end to the conflict. It reflects a pragmatic approach, prioritizing Europe above all else, and acknowledges the limited strategic value of distant colonies in our current war effort. However, a more moderate demand would involve the return of German colonies as they existed in 1914, but only those currently under Allied control. This would include territories such as German Southwest Africa, Togo, and Cameroon, among others. By reclaiming these colonies, we could restore a sense of national pride and partially redress the losses inflicted upon us by the Treaty of Versailles. Yet, this option could complicate negotiations and would only be feasible if the Allies are willing to make territorial concessions outside of Europe. The most ambitious proposal is to demand the return of our 1914 colonies and the establishment of German Mittelafrika, a vast colonial empire stretching across Central Africa. This vision aligns with the long-standing dream of creating a self-sufficient colonial empire that would provide resources and manpower to the Reich. However, it is the most provocative choice and would likely be met with staunch resistance from the Allies, as it would fundamentally alter the balance of power in Africa. Such demands would only be considered by the Allies if they were in an exceptionally desperate position, and pursuing them could risk derailing the peace process entirely. We must weigh the allure of restoring our colonial empire against the immediate need to secure peace on favorable terms."

 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.4.t:0 "The Italian Colonial Situation"
 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.4.d:0 "Our alliance with Italy has been crucial in securing our southern flank and maintaining pressure on the Western Allies. As we draft our peace proposal, we must also consider what rewards our Italian partners can expect for their continued support. The promises we make to Italy could strengthen our alliance and ensure their loyalty, but overly generous concessions could also alienate the Allies and complicate negotiations. The first option involves transferring Corsica, Savoy, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa to Italian control. This would significantly expand Italy’s influence in both the Mediterranean and East Africa, restoring territories that Italy has long coveted and solidifying their colonial ambitions. These gains would satisfy Italy’s strategic and nationalist desires without demanding too much from the Allies, making it a feasible reward that maintains balance in the Mediterranean while still appeasing our partner. Alternatively, we could offer Italy a more ambitious set of rewards, including not only Corsica, Savoy, Tunisia, Ethiopia, and the Horn of Africa but also Egypt. This option would dramatically increase Italy’s standing as a colonial power, positioning them as the dominant force in North Africa and the Suez Canal region. However, these expanded demands would likely provoke a fierce reaction from the Allies, as Egypt is a key strategic and economic asset, critical to British interests. Granting Italy such extensive territories would greatly strengthen our Axis coalition but could also prolong the war effort if the Allies refuse to cede such vital lands. This is a high-risk, high-reward choice that reflects our commitment to rewarding loyal allies but also our willingness to push the limits of what the Western Allies may tolerate in peace negotiations."

 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.5.t:0 "The Fate of France"
 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.5.d:0 "Mein Führer, One of the most critical decisions in our peace negotiations will be determining the future of France. Our approach to France’s fate will significantly impact the Allies' willingness to accept our terms. The more generous our offer, the more likely the Allies will agree. We have three main options, each with distinct implications for our control over Western Europe. The most appealing option for the Allies would be to restore a Free Democratic France, fully withdrawing German influence and reinstating the pre-war government. This would be seen as a major concession, signaling our commitment to peace, but would also mean giving up all control over France and the risk of future hostility from a restored rival in the West. The second option is to allow Vichy France to remain neutral and independent. This would create a buffer state, balancing our need for security with diplomatic flexibility. It offers a middle ground that the Allies might find acceptable, as it maintains French independence while reducing German influence, making peace more attainable. The least appealing to the Allies would be to turn Vichy France into a German satellite state. This ensures complete control over France and secures our southern flank, but it is the most aggressive stance, likely only acceptable if the Allies are in a desperate position. It maximizes our strategic advantage but risks outright rejection due to its provocative nature."

 EW_Scripted_Peace_Deals_Country.6.d:0 "Mein Führer, The fate of Britain is a pivotal issue in our peace negotiations. Our approach will shape the Western Allies' response, with each option presenting different strategic advantages and risks. The more lenient we are, the greater the likelihood of Allied acceptance, but at the cost of control. Conversely, more demanding terms may secure our influence but could provoke rejection unless the Allies are desperate for peace. The most conciliatory option would be to restore a Free Democratic Britain, completely independent and with its pre-war government reinstated. This approach would be the most appealing to the Allies, signaling a major concession and our willingness to end hostilities. However, it would also mean relinquishing all influence over Britain, reintroducing a potential rival on the global stage. An alternative middle-ground is establishing a Free Neutral Britain under Edward VIII, positioning Britain as a neutral power with a sympathetic but non-aligned government. This would create a buffer state, reducing tensions while maintaining a level of German influence without outright control. It balances the need for a secure peace with the Allies’ demand for British sovereignty. We could also pursue a more audacious path by installing Oswald Mosley and his fascist movement, creating a Free Fascist Britain aligned with our ideology but maintaining nominal independence. This would strengthen our ideological influence in the region, but it would still be viewed as a puppet regime by the Allies, and the offer would likely be met with fierce resistance unless Britain is severely weakened. The most aggressive stance is to turn Britain into a German satellite state, ensuring total control and securing the Western front. However, this would be the least likely to be accepted by the Allies, provoking them to fight on unless they are desperate for an end to the conflict. While it maximizes our influence, it carries the highest risk of prolonging the war."

We must consider the strategic benefits of each choice against the likelihood of Allied acceptance. The most conciliatory option is to restore Poland to its 1914 borders while leaving the rest of Poland independent and neutral. This approach would restore the pre-war borders and create a neutral buffer state, potentially making peace more acceptable to the Allies. However, it would mean limited control over Poland and maintaining its neutrality. Another option is to restore Poland to its 1914 borders while making the rest of Poland a German satellite state. This would grant us influence over Polish territories beyond the 1914 borders while still presenting a relatively moderate stance. It balances our strategic interests with a concession that may be more palatable to the Allies. We could also choose to retain Wartheland and Danzig-Westpreussen while making the rest of Poland a satellite state. This option allows us to keep key territories and exert influence over the remainder of Poland, but it still involves breaking up Polish sovereignty and may be less acceptable to the Allies compared to more moderate proposals. The most demanding stance is to annex all of Poland to the Reich. This would secure complete control over Polish territories and integrate them fully into the German Empire, but it is the least likely to be accepted by the Allies without significant concessions. This option maximizes our control but risks a strong Allied rejection."

The most accommodating option would be to keep the Sudetenland while leaving the rest of Bohemia and Moravia independent and neutral. This approach allows us to retain strategically significant territory while granting neutrality to the remaining regions, which could be seen as a reasonable concession by the Allies. It strikes a balance between our territorial interests and diplomatic considerations, potentially facilitating a peace agreement. Another option is to retain the Sudetenland while making the rest of Bohemia and Moravia a German satellite state. This would extend our influence over the region while still allowing for some degree of Czech independence. It represents a moderate compromise, offering strategic control while providing a level of concession that might be more acceptable to the Allies. The most demanding stance is to fully integrate Bohemia and Moravia into the Reich. This would ensure total control over the region, fully incorporating it into the German Empire.

This would allow Yugoslavia to maintain its sovereignty, signaling a significant concession and potentially improving our standing with the Allies. However, it would mean relinquishing direct control over the territory and could influence our position with our Axis allies. Another option is to partition Yugoslavia among Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria, following the historical partition. This would satisfy our Axis partners by dividing the territory according to their interests and maintaining influence over the region. It represents a moderate compromise, balancing control with the need for concessions. The most demanding stance is to partition Yugoslavia as described above, but with the additional condition that Italy receives the Dalmatian coast.

The options we choose will affect not only our control over the British Isles but also the fate of this important union. Our decisions here will have significant implications for Allied responses and the stability of the region. The most accommodating option is to return Britain to the British-Canadian Union, reinstating the pre-war merger and ensuring that Britain and Canada remain united under a single government. This approach would signal a major concession, demonstrating our willingness to preserve the union and potentially easing Allied tensions. However, it would also mean relinquishing control over Britain and maintaining the status quo with Canada, which could complicate our strategic position.
