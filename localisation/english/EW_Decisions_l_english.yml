GER_EW_Decisions_desc:0 "During World War II, Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, sought to establish a totalitarian regime and expand its territorial control across Europe. The primary goals of Nazi Germany included the creation of a vast empire dominated by the so-called Aryan race, the extermination of Jews and other groups deemed undesirable, and the acquisition of Lebensraum (living space) to ensure the economic and strategic dominance of the Third Reich. This expansionist ideology led to the invasion of numerous countries, resulting in widespread devastation and a relentless campaign of military aggression that reshaped the geopolitical landscape of Europe."

JAP_EW_Decisions_desc:0 "During World War II, Japan, under the leadership of Emperor Hirohito and Prime Minister Tojo Hideki, aimed to establish itself as a dominant power in Asia and the Pacific. The Japanese goals included the creation of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which envisioned Japanese hegemony over East and Southeast Asia, and the acquisition of resources to fuel its militaristic ambitions. This expansionist policy led to the invasion of China, the attack on Pearl Harbor, and subsequent military campaigns across the Pacific, resulting in widespread occupation, significant regional conflicts, and a brutal regime marked by intense nationalism and aggression."

SOV_EW_Decisions:0 "Soviet War Actions"
SOV_EW_Decisions_desc:0 "During World War II, the Soviet Union, led by Joseph Stalin and the Communist Party, sought to expand its influence and secure its borders while advancing its ideological goals. The Soviet objectives included the protection and consolidation of the USSR's territory, the defeat of the Axis powers, and the promotion of communist ideology across Europe and Asia. This ambition drove the Soviets to endure significant sacrifices on the Eastern Front, engage in large-scale military operations, and ultimately aim to reshape the post-war world order in favor of Soviet interests and socialist principles. The war effort also facilitated the USSR's rise as a superpower, leading to its prominent role in the ensuing Cold War."

Mussolini’s goals included expanding Italy’s territorial control across the Mediterranean and Africa, asserting dominance in the region, and aligning with Nazi Germany to influence European affairs. Italy aimed to achieve this through military aggression and strategic alliances, seeking to reshape the balance of power in Europe and assert its role as a key player on the global stage. Despite initial successes, Italy's military campaigns ultimately faced significant challenges, and the country’s involvement in the Axis coalition had mixed results."

The Allies also aimed to uphold democratic values and human rights, prevent future conflicts through collective security, and establish a new international order that would promote economic recovery and cooperation. Their coordinated military and diplomatic efforts eventually led to the Axis powers' defeat and the formation of key post-war institutions, such as the United Nations, to foster global peace and security."

Hungary and Romania, aligning with the Axis, pursued territorial gains and regional influence. Their collective goals included dismantling the post-World War I order, dominating Europe through military aggression, and establishing a new geopolitical and ideological order based on their totalitarian and expansionist visions."

USA_send_lend_lease_EW:0 "Send Lend Lease to our Allies"
USA_send_lend_lease_EW_desc:0 "Sending Lend-Lease aid to our allies is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it strengthens the collective fight against the Axis powers, enhancing the overall military capacity of nations like Britain, the Soviet Union, and China who are on the front lines of the global struggle for freedom. By providing them with essential military equipment, supplies, and resources, we not only bolster their defense capabilities but also ensure that our own security interests are safeguarded. This aid helps to sustain our allies' resistance against aggressive totalitarian regimes, reducing the risk of them succumbing to Axis pressures and thereby creating a more favorable global strategic environment. Furthermore, supporting our allies through Lend-Lease fosters strong international partnerships and promotes a unified front, which is vital for the eventual victory and post-war reconstruction. Ultimately, Lend-Lease is not merely a matter of generosity but a strategic investment in a collective effort to achieve lasting peace and stability."
