This expansionist ideology led to the invasion of numerous countries, resulting in widespread devastation and a relentless campaign of military aggression that reshaped the geopolitical landscape of Europe."

The Japanese goals included the creation of a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which envisioned Japanese hegemony over East and Southeast Asia, and the acquisition of resources to fuel its militaristic ambitions.

The Soviet objectives included the protection and consolidation of the USSR's territory, the defeat of the Axis powers, and the promotion of communist ideology across Europe and Asia. This ambition drove the Soviets to endure significant sacrifices on the Eastern Front, engage in large-scale military operations, and ultimately aim to reshape the post-war world order in favor of Soviet interests and socialist principles.

Their collective goals included dismantling the post-World War I order, dominating Europe through military aggression, and establishing a new geopolitical and ideological order based on their totalitarian and expansionist visions."
