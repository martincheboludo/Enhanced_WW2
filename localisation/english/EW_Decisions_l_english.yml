SS_EW_Decisions:0 "Schutzstaffel (SS) Actions"
SS_EW_Decisions_desc:0 "The Schutzstaffel (SS) was a paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, originally established in 1925 as a small bodyguard unit for Hitler. It rapidly expanded in influence and power, becoming a key instrument in enforcing Nazi policies and committing war crimes during World War II. The SS was divided into two main branches: the Waffen-SS, which served as a combat force alongside the regular German military, and the Allgemeine SS, which focused on internal security and ideological enforcement. The Allgemeine SS was notably responsible for running concentration camps and executing the regime's genocidal policies. The SS, under leaders like Heinrich Himmler, played a central role in the Holocaust, overseeing the systematic murder of six million Jews and millions of others deemed undesirable by the Nazi regime."
