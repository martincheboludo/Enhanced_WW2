 EW_Germany_Country.0.t:0 "Partition of Greece"
 EW_Germany_Country.0.d:0 "As we finalize our plans for the division of Greece, we have two primary options for partitioning the territory. Each option offers distinct advantages and strategic benefits. The first option is the 'Historical Partition,' where Greece would be divided as follows; Bulgaria would receive Thrace, Germany would take a portion of Thrace and Crete, and Italy would gain control of the remaining parts of Greece. This division respects historical claims and ensures that each Axis power receives a share of the territory. The alternative is to "Partition Between Italy and Bulgaria," where Germany would cede its portions of Greek territory to our allies. In this scenario, Bulgaria would receive all of Thrace, while Italy would take control of Crete. This approach allows us to focus on other strategic priorities while rewarding our Axis partners with significant territorial gains."

 EW_Germany_Country.1.t:0 "Partition of Yugoslavia"
 EW_Germany_Country.1.d:0 "With Yugoslavia now under our control, we face a critical decision on how to partition the territory. We have two main options. The first is the 'Historical Partition,' where Yugoslavia is divided among Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria, with puppet states established in Croatia and Serbia. This approach follows the historical precedent and ensures that each Axis power receives a share of the territory. The second option is the 'Enhanced Partition,' which maintains the same division but includes an additional concession—granting Italy control of the Dalmatian coast. This adjustment rewards Italy with a strategically valuable region while still distributing the rest of Yugoslavia among the Axis powers. Your choice will determine our influence in Southeastern Europe and affect our relationships with our Axis allies. We must weigh the strategic benefits of each option carefully to ensure continued unity and maximize our advantage."

 EW_Germany_Country.2.t:0 "Partition of Switzerland"
 EW_Germany_Country.2.d:0 "As we finalize our plans for Switzerland, we must decide on the division of the country to meet our strategic and diplomatic objectives. We have two main options for partitioning Switzerland along linguistic lines. The first option is to partition Switzerland with Italy, dividing the country into German, Italian, and French-speaking regions. Under this arrangement, Germany would receive the German-speaking parts, Italy would control the Italian-speaking regions, and the French-speaking area (Romandie) would be allocated to Germany. The second option is to expand the partition to include France. In this scenario, Germany would still take the German-speaking regions and Italy the Italian-speaking areas, but the French-speaking Romandie would be divided between Germany and France. This would ensure a more balanced distribution of the French-speaking region, providing France with a share while still maintaining German control over significant portions. Your decision will shape our influence in the region and affect our relationships with Italy and France. Consider the strategic and diplomatic impacts of each option carefully."

 EW_Germany_Country.15.t:0 "Partition of Poland"
 EW_Germany_Country.15.d:0 "As we finalize the partition of Poland with the Soviet Union, we face a crucial decision on how to divide the territory. We have two options to consider. The first option is to partition Poland along the borders of 1914. Under this arrangement, Germany would control the regions held before World War I, while the rest of Poland would be ceded to the USSR. The second option is to follow the historical 1939 partition, where Poland is divided as per the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. In this case, Germany would retain control over the western part of Poland, while the USSR would occupy the eastern regions. Your decision will shape our strategic positioning in Eastern Europe and affect our relations with the Soviet Union. Please choose the option that best aligns with our long-term goals."

 EW_Germany_News.15.d:0 "Poland has been partitioned by the Axis powers and the Soviet Union. In the latest development, Germany and the USSR have agreed on the division of Polish territory. Under one arrangement, Poland is divided along the borders of 1914, with Germany controlling the regions it held before World War I, and the remaining areas being ceded to the Soviet Union. Alternatively, the partition follows the historical 1939 agreement, with Germany retaining control over the western part of Poland and the Soviet Union occupying the eastern regions. This division significantly alters the political landscape in Eastern Europe and reflects the expanding influence of both the Axis powers and the Soviet Union. The international community is closely monitoring the situation."

 EW_Germany_Country.16.d:0 "As we approach the final stages of our campaign against the Soviet Union, it is crucial to determine the distribution of the conquered territories. The proposed partition plan is as follows; Germany will annex the USSR up to the Urals, consolidating our control over the vast central and western regions. Finland will be rewarded with Murmansk and Karelia, expanding into a Greater Finland. Romania will regain the territories it lost, along with additional areas it occupied during the conflict. Japan will receive territories in Siberia and Outer Manchuria, enhancing its influence in the east. The remaining parts of the USSR will be divided into two satellite states; a rump Russian state under our control and a Turkestan satellite, reflecting the diverse ethnic composition of the region. Your decision will finalize the strategic distribution of these territories and shape the future political landscape of Eurasia. Please approve the proposed division to implement our strategic objectives."

 EW_Germany_Country.17.d:0 "Vichy France, officially the French State, was the French rump state headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain during World War II. It was named after its seat of government, the city of Vichy. Officially independent, but with half of its territory occupied under the harsh terms of the 1940 armistice with Nazi Germany, it adopted a policy of collaboration. Though Paris was nominally its capital, the government established itself in the resort town of Vichy in the unoccupied 'free zone' (zone libre), where it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as its colonies. The occupation of France by Nazi Germany at first affected only the northern and western portions of the country, but in November 1942 the Germans and Italians occupied the remainder of Metropolitan France, ending any pretence of independence by the Vichy government."

 EW_Germany_Country.18.d:0 "In this alternate history, the outcome of World War II took a startling turn when Operation Sea Lion, Germany's plan to invade and occupy the United Kingdom, proved remarkably successful. Under the strategic brilliance of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces executed a meticulously planned amphibious assault in 1941. A combination of surprise tactics, advanced weaponry, and coordination with the Luftwaffe resulted in the rapid fall of British defenses. Winston Churchill, caught off guard, was forced into exile as German forces, with unexpected efficiency, secured control over key British cities. The occupation marked a significant shift in the war's dynamics, altering the course of European history.

International powers either lend support or remain neutral, preventing Western intervention on behalf of China. Internal divisions within China's Nationalist and Communist forces, coupled with a lack of popular support for the resistance, further contribute to Japan's success. The Japanese occupation is marked by efficient governance, successful assimilation efforts, and a negotiated settlement that establishes a puppet government in China with Japanese influence. With East Asia firmly under Japanese control, the dynamics of World War II are reshaped, as Japan focuses on consolidating power in the region rather than engaging in a broader conflict with the Allies."

An attack now, while the fascists are distracted, could be the masterstroke that propels the Revolution to every corner of Europe. However, we must tread carefully. If we begin preparations for an offensive operation, it is possible that the Germans, perceiving this as a threat, might use it as an excuse to launch a preemptive strike against us. Such a daring move is not without risk. If our forces falter and the Germans rally, the Motherland could suffer unimaginable devastation. The fury of the fascist counteroffensive could roll over our cities, and the Soviet experiment might be snuffed out before it reaches its full potential. The path to victory is fraught with peril, but the reward—the complete destruction of the fascist beast and the triumph of socialism—beckons us. What shall be our course, Comrade Stalin?

This system allows the United States to support its allies—namely, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China—through a streamlined and historically accurate delivery of war supplies. The Lend-Lease system works by sending equipment in monthly increments, equating to 1/12 of the total amount the recipient historically received in a given year. This aid includes crucial resources such as infantry equipment, planes, tanks, artillery, and trucks. The system has specific conditions for receiving aid; the Soviet Union must control key ports like Murmansk or Vladivostok, or border a British or Indian-controlled state to receive Lend-Lease. China must border a British or Indian-controlled state to qualify for aid. If the United States is controlled by a player, the equipment sent is deducted from the U.S. stockpile, requiring careful management of resources. However, if the United States is controlled by the AI, the equipment is spawned without being deducted from stockpiles, creating a continuous flow of support that can significantly bolster allied forces. Enabling the AI to use this Lend-Lease system makes the game much more challenging for Axis players, as the steady influx of supplies will ensure that the USSR and China rarely run out of equipment, making their defeat far more difficult.
