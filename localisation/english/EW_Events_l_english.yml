 EW_Germany_Country.2.d:0 "In August 1942, Hitler further described Switzerland as 'a pimple on the face of Europe' and as a state that no longer had a right to exist, denouncing the Swiss people as 'a misbegotten branch of our Volk.' From a Nazi viewpoint, Switzerland, as a small, multilingual, decentralized democracy where German-speakers felt more of an affinity with their French-speaking fellow Swiss citizens than towards their German brothers across the border, was the antithesis of the racially homogeneous and collectivised 'Führer State'. Hitler also believed that the independent Swiss state had come into existence at a time of temporary weakness of the Holy Roman Empire, and now that German power had been re-established after the National Socialist takeover, the independent country of Switzerland had become obsolete."

Throughout the entire course of the occupation, the territory of Poland was divided between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (USSR), both of which intended to eradicate Poland's culture and subjugate its people. In the summer-autumn of 1941, the lands which were annexed by the Soviets were overrun by Germany in the course of the initially successful German attack on the USSR.

 EW_Germany_Country.16.d:0 "Operation Barbarossa was the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany and many of its Axis allies, starting on Sunday, 22 June 1941, during the Second World War. It was the largest land offensive in human history, with around 10 million combatants taking part. The operation, code-named after Frederick Barbarossa ('red beard'), a 12th-century Holy Roman Emperor and Crusader, put into action Nazi Germany's ideological goal of conquering the western Soviet Union to repopulate it with Germans. The German Generalplan Ost aimed to use some of the conquered people as forced labour for the Axis war effort while acquiring the oil reserves of the Caucasus as well as the agricultural resources of various Soviet territories, including Ukraine and Byelorussia. Their ultimate goal was to create more Lebensraum (living space) for Germany, and the eventual extermination of the native Slavic peoples by mass deportation to Siberia, Germanisation, enslavement, and genocide."

It was named after its seat of government, the city of Vichy. Officially independent, but with half of its territory occupied under the harsh terms of the 1940 armistice with Nazi Germany, it adopted a policy of collaboration. Though Paris was nominally its capital, the government established itself in the resort town of Vichy in the unoccupied 'free zone' (zone libre), where it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as its colonies. The occupation of France by Nazi Germany at first affected only the northern and western portions of the country, but in November 1942 the Germans and Italians occupied the remainder of Metropolitan France, ending any pretence of independence by the Vichy government."

 EW_Germany_Country.18.d:0 "In this alternate history, the outcome of World War II took a startling turn when Operation Sea Lion, Germany's plan to invade and occupy the United Kingdom, proved remarkably successful. Under the strategic brilliance of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, German forces executed a meticulously planned amphibious assault in 1941. A combination of surprise tactics, advanced weaponry, and coordination with the Luftwaffe resulted in the rapid fall of British defenses. Winston Churchill, caught off guard, was forced into exile as German forces, with unexpected efficiency, secured control over key British cities. The occupation marked a significant shift in the war's dynamics, altering the course of European history.

International powers either lend support or remain neutral, preventing Western intervention on behalf of China.
